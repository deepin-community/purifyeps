Description
-----------

While pdfLaTeX has a number of nice features, its primary shortcoming
relative to standard LaTeX+dvips is that it is unable to read ordinary
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, the most common graphics format
in the LaTeX world.  purifyeps converts EPS files into a "purified"
form that can be read by *both* LaTeX+dvips and pdfLaTeX.  The trick
is that the standard LaTeX2e graphics packages can parse
MetaPost-produced EPS directly.  Hence, purifyeps need only convert an
arbitrary EPS file into the same stylized format that MetaPost
outputs.

Documentation is provided in Unix man-page format and in PDF
(U.S. letter-sized).  In addition, executing "purifyeps --help" gives
basic command-line usage.


Requirements
------------

To run purifyeps, you will need the following:

   * Perl     (http://www.cpan.org)

   * pstoedit (http://www.pstoedit.net/pstoedit)

   * a LaTeX distribution that includes MetaPost (mpost)

purifyeps itself is a Perl script.  On certain operating systems, you
may need to rename purifyeps (e.g., to purifyeps.pl) to notify the
system that purifyeps is, in fact, a Perl script.
