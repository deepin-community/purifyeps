Description: creates EPS files usable in TeX and pdfTeX
 While pdfLaTeX has a number of nice features, its primary shortcoming
 relative to standard LaTeX+dvips is that it is unable to read ordinary
 Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, the most common graphics format
 in the LaTeX world. purifyeps converts EPS files into a "purified"
 form that can be read by *both* LaTeX+dvips and pdfLaTeX.
